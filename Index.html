					<h2>About Me</h2>
					
					<img class="img-1" src="images/KungFu.jfif" alt="Head Shot">
					<p>
						My passion is working with professionals to redesign their work to improve outcomes and efficiency.  I have pursued this through a career in the aluminum business, e-commerce and healthcare.  Georgia Tech's Web Development Boot Camp is providing me with a new set of tools to understand how fullstack development can better manage knowledge-driven decision making.   
					</p>
					<br>
					<p> 
						The last ten years I have collaborated with physicians and other healthcare providers to develop algorithms to better control blood coagulation and blood glucose in critically ill patients.  I wrote computer programs to enable nurses to apply these algorithms in critical care without the need for constant physician intervention.  It is my hope that the tools taught in Boot Camp will enable me to rewrite these programs for better control and distribution.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p> 
						I live in Alpharetta, GA with my wife, two children and a labradoodle. When not at my computer I enjoy hiking, fishing, rowing and travelling.
